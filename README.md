node-LDAP 1.2.0
===============

OpenLDAP client bindings for Node.js. Requires libraries from
http://www.openldap.org installed.

This latest version implements proper reconnects to a lost LDAP server.

Of note in this release is access to LDAP Syncrepl. With this API, you
can subscribe to changes to the LDAP database, and be notified (and
fire a callback) when anything is changed in LDAP. Use Syncrepl to
completely mirror an LDAP database, or use it to implement triggers
that perform an action when LDAP is modified.

The API is finally stable, and (somewhat) sane.

Dependencies

Node >= 0.8

Install
=======

You must ensure you have the latest OpenLDAP client libraries
installed from http://www.openldap.org

To install the latest release from npm:

    npm install LDAP

If this fails, please ensure you have uuid.h available (on Ubuntu,
install the uuid-dev package).


API
===

    new LDAP(otions);

Creating an instance:

```js
var LDAP = require('LDAP');
var ldap = new LDAP({
    uri: 'ldap://my.ldap.server',
    version: 3,
    connecttimeout: 1,
    reconnect: true
});
```

ldap.open()
-----------

    ldap.open(function(err));

Now that you have an instance, you can open a connection. This will
automatically reconnect until you close():

```js
ldap.open(function(err) {
    if (err) {
       throw new Error('Can not connect');
    }
    // connection is ready.

});
```

You can disable the automatic reconnect by setting the `reconnect`
option to false.

ldap.simplebind()
-----------------
Calling open automatically does an anonymous bind to check to make
sure the connection is actually open. If you call simplebind(), you
will upgrade the existing anonymous bind.

    ldap.simplebind(bind_options, function(err));

Options are binddn and password:

```js
bind_options = {
    binddn: '',
    password: ''
}
```

ldap.search()
-------------
    ldap.search(search_options, function(err, data));

Options are provided as a JS object:

```js
search_options = {
    base: '',
    scope: '',
    filter: '',
    attrs: ''
}
```

Scopes are specified as one of the following integers:

* Connection.BASE = 0;
* Connection.ONELEVEL = 1;
* Connection.SUBTREE = 2;
* Connection.SUBORDINATE = 3;
* Connection.DEFAULT = -1;

Results are returned as an array of zero or more objects. Each object
has attributes named after the LDAP attributes in the found
record(s). Each attribute contains an array of values for that
attribute (even if the attribute is single-valued - having to check typeof()
before you can act on /anything/ is a pet peeve of
mine). The exception to this rule is the 'dn' attribute - this is
always a single-valued string.

```js
[ { gidNumber: [ '2000' ],
  objectClass: [ 'posixAccount', 'top', 'account' ],
  uidNumber: [ '3214' ],
  uid: [ 'fred' ],
  homeDirectory: [ '/home/fred' ],
  cn: [ 'fred' ],
  dn: 'cn=fred,dc=ssimicro,dc=com' } ]
```

LDAP servers are usually limited in how many items they are willing to return -
1024 or 4096 are some typical values. For larger LDAP directories, you need to
either partition your results with filter, or use paged search. To get
a paged search, add the following attributes to your search request:

```js
search_options = {
    base: '',
    scope: '',
    filter: '',
    attrs: '',
    pagesize: n
}
```

The callback will be called with a new parameter: cookie. Pass this
cookie back in subsequent searches to get the next page of results:

```js
search_options = {
    base: '',
    scope: '',
    filter: '',
    attrs: '',
    pagesize: n,
    cookie: cookie
}
```

As of version 1.2.0 you can also read the rootDSE entry of an ldap server.
To do so, simply issue a read request with base set to an empty string:

```js
search_options = {
  base: '',
  scope: Connection.BASE,  // 0
  // ... other options as necessary
}
```

ldap.findandbind()
------------------
A convenience function that is in here only to encourage developers to
do LDAP authentication "the right way" if possible.

    ldap.findandbind(fb_options, function(err, data))

Options are exactly like the search options, with the addition of a
"password" attribute:

```js
fb_options = {
    base: '',
    filter: '',
    scope: '',
    attrs: '',
    password: ''
}
```

Calls the callback with the record it authenticated against.

Note: since findandbind leaves the connection in an authenticated
state, you probably don't want to do a findandbind with a general
purpose instance of this library, as you would be sending one user's
queries on the authenticated connection of the last user to log
in. Depending on your configuration, this may not even be an issue,
but you should be aware.

Did someone say that asyncronous programming wasn't perilous?

There are three obvious solutions to this problem:

* Use two instances of this library (and thus two TCP connections) -
  one for authenication binds, and the other for general purpose use
  (which may be pre-bound as admin or some other suitably priveleged
  user). You are then completely in charge of authorization (can this
  user edit that user?).

* Create a new instance for each authenticated user, and reconnect
  that user to their own instance with each page load. The advantage of
  this strategy is you can then rely on LDAP's authorization systems
  (slapd then decides what each user can and can't do).

* Create, bind, and close a connection for each user's initial visit, and
  use cookies and session trickery for subsequent visits.

ldap.add()
----------

    ldap.add(dn, [attrs], function(err))

dn is the full DN of the record you want to add, attrs to be provided
as follows:

```js
var attrs = [
    { attr: 'objectClass',  vals: [ 'organizationalPerson', 'person', 'top' ] },
    { attr: 'sn',           vals: [ 'Smith' ] },
    { attr: 'badattr',      vals: [ 'Fried' ] }
]
```

ldap.modify()
-------------

    ldap.modify(dn, [ changes ], function(err))

Modifies the provided dn as per the changes array provided. Ops are
one of "add", "delete" or "replace".

```js
var changes = [
    { op: 'add',
      attr: 'title',
      vals: [ 'King of Callbacks' ]
    }
]
```

ldap.rename()
-------------

    ldap.rename(dn, newrdn, function(err))

Will rename the entry to the new RDN provided.

Example:

```js
ldap.rename('cn=name,dc=example,dc=com', 'cn=newname')
```

ldap.remove()
-------------

    ldap.remove(dn, function(err))

Deletes an entry.

Example:

```js
ldap.remove('cn=name,dc=example,dc=com', function(err) {
  if (err) {
    // Could not delete entry
  }
});
```

Schema
======

To instantiate:

```js
var LDAP = require('LDAP');
var schema = new LDAP.Schema({
    init_attr: function(attr),
    init_obj: function(obj),
    ready: function()
})
```

init_attr is called as each attribute is added so you can
augment the attributes as they are loaded (add friendly labels, for
instance). Similarly, init_obj is called as each objectClass is loaded
so you can add your own properties to objectClasses.

ready is called when the schema has been completely loaded from the server.

Once the schema are loaded, you can get an objectClass like this:

    schema.getObjectClass('person')

Get a specific attribute:

    schema.getAttribute('cn');

Given a LDAP search, result, get all the possible attributes associated with it:

    schema.getAttributesForRec(searchres);


SYNCREPL API
============

If you are connecting to an LDAP server with syncrepl overlay enabled,
you can be notified of updates to the LDAP tree. Begin by connecting,
then issue the ldap.sync() command:

    ldap.sync(options)

The options are as follows:

```js
{
    base: '',
    scope: ldap.SUBTREE,
    filter: '(objectClass=*)',
    attrs: '* +',
    rid: '000',
    cookie: '',
    syncentry: function(data),
    syncintermediate: function(data),
    syncresult: function(data)
}
```

The cookie attribute is used to send a cookie to the server to ensure
sync continues where you last left off.

The rid attribute is required, and should be set to a unique value for
the server you are syncing to.

The function callbacks are called upon initial refresh, and as new
data is available.

syncentry(data)
--------------------------------
When this callback fires, you should call ldap.getcookie() to record the
current cookie and save it somewhere. You can provide this cookie to the
ldap.sync() call when your process restarts.


syncintermediate()
-----------------
TBD.

syncresult(data)
---------------
TBD.

getcookie()
----------
This function returns the current cookie from the sync session. You can
provide this cookie on the next run to pick up where you left off syncing.


TODO:
-----
* Integration testing for syncrepl.
* Real-world testing of syncrepl.
* Testing against Microsoft Active Directory is welcome as I don't
have a server to test against.

Schema-in-JSON
==============
These are the OpenLDAP schema files converted to JSON. They are split
into two files: default.schema and nonstandard.schema.

They are spearate as I am able to generate default.schema
automatically from the OpenLDAP distribution files. The nonstandard
entries are commented out in the OpenLDAP dist, so I have left them in
a separate file so they don't get clobbered if I generate a new JSON
schema file.
